- âš¡ Mission: ...
        The moonshot is to produce modular infrastructures as code.
	It guarantees scalability and reliability of the network services. I believe the network should not be treated as a black box that is complicated to access.
	This is why I use automation as part of my network as a service strategy. Simple is always better than complex, so is Maendeleolab.
